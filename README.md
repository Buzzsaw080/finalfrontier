# finalfrontier

This is a gamemode meant for Garry's Mod, originaly developed by Metapyziks, now updated and (somewhat) maintained by me, Lawlypops.
Feel free to take a peek at it and if you have any issues, you can submit a bug report, or if you're a programmer, branch and make a pull request.

Installation:
1. Place the finalfrontier-master folder into ..\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons
2. Start up the game, go to the bottom right and select the gamemode.
3. Start New Game. Make sure to select the FinalFrontier map.
4. Start!

I'm not all that available to work on this, but I will when I'm in the mood to.
Now that i've learned a lot more about GMod LUA since I first took over this project, I'm a bit more confident and MAY start working on it a bit more. (No Promises)
